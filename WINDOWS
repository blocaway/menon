Since Windows uses a different set of permissions for file system access, a barely POSIX compliant Cygwin environment may strugle with some basic tasks using "#!/bin/sh"! You'll need to build this one by hand (you will require root permisssions).

1. Provision the local environment:

	# mv motd /etc

	# mv root /usr/spool/crontabs

	# mv index.html /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs
   

Unpack the distribution (specifying your associated internet handle in place of "usr"):
 
	# mv -ifsv menon /home/"usr"

	# mv -ifsv templates /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs

2. After the build process has completed (go back into the current user directory): 

	# cd ..

	# ln -s /home/"usr"/menon /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs/templates/TSO

	# ln -s /home/"usr"/menon /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs/templates/test

3. Change directory to "menon" and start the web server:

	# cd menon; apachectl start
	
	Run with --help or -h for options.

4. Determine the kernel's associated IP address:
	
	$ ifconfig

5. In the browser go to the associated IP address (e.g. 10.x.x.1xx) and there you'll see:
	
	"Hello Universe!"

6. Use "menon.db" in order to create the database (you will require root permissions):

	$ su root 
	
	$ sqlite3 menon.db < create.sql
	
	$ sqlite3 menon.db < update/time/insert.sql
	
	$ sqlite3 menon.db < update/space/insert.sql

7. Use "menon" to build a new app (specifying your associated internet handle in place of "usr"):

	$ cd menon

	$ mkdir app
	
	$ echo "A new app!" > index.html

	$ mv index.html /home/"usr"/menon/app

	$ touch menon.db

	$ ln -s /home/"usr"/menon /home/"usr"/menon/app

	$ ln -s /home/"usr"/menon/app /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs

8. The new project can be accessed at the associated IP address 10.x.x.1xx/app

	"A new app!"
	
9, Build the stream-oriented network socket (Remember, the app can be edited within user space, however kernel space must be used in order to operate on the data model):

	$ su root
	
	$ make

10. In order to handle API calls from the client open an additional terminal window, login and open the network socket and select a port number between 2000 - 65535 letting it run within user space (The socket will remain open, forking off a separate process for each connection):

	$ cd menon

	$ ./server XXXXX

11. In order to get API request edit "sftpbs" providing the appropriate address to the client (e.g. usr@10.x.x.1xx), then open an additional terminal window again, login and execute the SFTP proxy server over TCP:

	$ cd menon

	$ su root ./sftpbs

12. To completely remove the distribution:

	cd ..

	rm -f /etc/motd

	rm -f /usr/spool/crontabs/root

	rm -rf menon

	rm -rf blocaway-menonstack-0.8-minix-3.2.0

	rm -f /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs/index.html

	rm -rf /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs/templates

	rm -rf /usr/pkg/share/httpd/htdocs/app
